question,answer
"What is artificial intelligence?","Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems."
"How does machine learning differ from AI?","Machine learning is a subset of AI where machines learn from data without explicit programming."
"What are neural networks?","Neural networks are computational models inspired by human neural connections, widely used for pattern recognition."
"Can AI systems understand natural language?","Yes, natural language processing (NLP) enables AI to interpret, understand, and generate human languages."
"What's the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?","Supervised learning trains models on labeled datasets, while unsupervised learning identifies patterns from unlabeled data."
"Why is data quality important in AI?","Good quality data ensures accurate, reliable AI outcomes. Poor data can mislead the AI model."
"What is reinforcement learning?","Reinforcement learning involves training models to make sequences of decisions by rewarding desired outcomes."
"How do recommendation systems work?","Recommendation systems use user data to predict preferences and suggest relevant items or content."
