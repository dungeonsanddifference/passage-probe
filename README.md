# PassageProbe

This Python script creates an efficient semantic search system over a directory of text files using SQLite and vector embeddings generated by [SentenceTransformers](https://www.sbert.net/). It indexes textual data and allows you to search semantically (by meaning) rather than just using simple keyword matching.

This is my submission for [Boot.dev](boot.dev) Hackathon 2025.

## Background

One frustration I've encountered frequently in large organizations is how challenging it can be to find relevant documentation using traditional keyword search. Shared vocabulary often leads to results that are related only superficially, missing the deeper context and meaning I'm actually seeking. Driven by this challenge, I've developed an interest in semantic search that prioritizes meaning over simple keyword matching.

This project represents my exploration into practical solutions using NLP to enhance search effectiveness.

## Overview

- **Semantic Indexing:** Reads text files from a directory, splits them into chunks, computes embeddings with SentenceTransformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2` by default), and stores them in a SQLite database with the [`sqlite_vec`](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec) sqlite3 extension.
- **Semantic Search:** Retrieves the most semantically relevant text chunks from indexed files given a natural language query.

---

## Features

- **Fast Semantic Retrieval:** Quickly retrieve semantically relevant text from numerous documents.
- **Incremental Indexing:** Indexes only new files upon each run.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Configure the embedding model, chunk sizes, overlap, and file filtering.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dungeonsanddifference/passage-probe.git
cd passage-probe
```

### 2. Setup Environment with `uv`

Ensure you have `uv` installed. If not, install via your package manager of choice or:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Set up a virtual environment and dependencies with `uv`:

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install .
```

## Usage

Run indexing and interactive semantic search with:

```bash
uv run main.py
```

### Interactive Search

* Enter a natural language query when prompted.
* Results displayed by semantic relevance.

Example:

```
Query (blank to quit) > What is semantic indexing?

Top results:

[1] /path/to/docs/semantic_search.md#chunk3 (dist=0.1234)
    Semantic indexing refers to indexing documents based on meaning rather than exact keywords. It leverages vector embeddings to represent texts semantically…

    In natural language processing, semantic indexing is essential for retrieving relevant documents based on meaning instead of keyword frequency…
